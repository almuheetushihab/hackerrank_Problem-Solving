//Number steps
//Many programming languages have built-in functions that output sequences of numbers separated by steps.
// Create your own Kotlin function from scratch that creates a sequenced list of numbers from 0 to a maximum input value and input step.
// For example, a maximum value of 8 and a step value of 2 should return an output of [2, 4, 6, 8].
//
//If you’re looking for more of a challenge, create a Fibonacci sequence generator.
// Remember that the following number of a Fibonacci sequence is the sum of the two preceding it: [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13].
